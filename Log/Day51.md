# :white_check_mark: Day 51: Expading your horizons

Day 51 is about watching conference talks that Paul Gave, the two bellow especifically, these were my thoughts on them.

## Elements of Functional Programming

As Paul says in the beggining of the talk, functional programming can be scary, it certainly is for me, but after watching this it is a lot less scary. This talk helped me so much understanding the functional parts of Swift, especially map() and flatMap() fucntions, the ones I used to struggle the most . The examples were simple and realistic making the topic clear and nice.

## Teaching Swift at Scale

Definetly one of the best talks I've watched so far, so much content and information delivered in these 30 minutes, and all while having a lot of laughs. I identify with most of the struggles presented by Paul, and the solutions to most of them really helped. Also gave me a good insight on the whole Swift language and community.
